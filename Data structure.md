**What is Data-Structure?**
~ A data structure is the systematic way to organize data so that it can be used efficiently.
~The efficiency of a data structure is always measured in time and space
~ex: Array

**What is Data-Type ?**
~User defined data type- Structure, union and enumeration

**What is Abstract Data Type ?**
~They are like user defined dtype which defines operation on values using function without specifying what is there inside the function and how the operation are performed
~ADT provide Abstraction means it hides the data from the user.

**What is Linear Data Structure ?**
~A data Structure is linear when all the elements are arranged in a linear order- stack, array, queue, linked list

**What is non linear Data Structure**
~A data structure is non linear when all the elements are not arranged in a linear order-Tree, graph

**Types of pointer**
* void pointer-A pointer which has no associated data type with it 

- null pointer-A pointer that does not point to any memory location. It represent an invalid memory location
- Dangling pointer- Which contains points to some non-existing memory location
- Wild pointers- usually point to some arbitrary memory location
