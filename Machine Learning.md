`Introduction`
**[Machine learning](https://www.ibm.com/design/ai/basics/ml/)** is a way of developing a model which can learn on it's own without externally coding.

`example`
Assume you have a cousin who made fortune in real estate  by predicting values in the past, and he says it's just intuition. But more questioning revels that he's identified prize patterns from houses he has seen in the past, and use those pattern to make prediction, ML also works the same way.

`Train-model`
So to train a model we require a knowledge of **Python** library called **scikitlearn** library. so to train a model we use a function known as **[DescisionTreeRegresor](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor.html)*** before fiting the data make sure to process the data with pandas.

`MODEL-Validation`
After Training a model we should know how much of accuracy it holds, to measure that accuracy we use a function from **scikitlearn** known as [mean_absolute_error](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.mean_absolute_error.html).
