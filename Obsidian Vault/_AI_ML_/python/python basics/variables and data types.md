**Definition**
	*Variable* 
		Simple-  A name for the memory location in which data is stored and overtime the data can be manipulated.
		Own- *nil*
	*Data type*
		Simple- data type refers toÂ **the type of value a variable has and what type of mathematical, relational or logical operations can be applied without causing an error**.
		Own- the kind of data that the variable can hold.

this feature is not *available in python* but is a important feature for optimisation and is used side by side with variables
 *pointers*- is a object that holds the memory address of another variable.  this is used to reduce the amount of data being transferred/stored in memory.

**Different types of *Data types
1. **Numeric Types:**
    
    - **int:** Integer data type represents whole numbers.
    - **float:** Float data type represents decimal numbers.
    - **complex:** Complex data type represents complex numbers in the form *a+bi*, where a and b are floats and i is the imaginary unit.
2. **Sequence Types:**
    
    - **str:** String data type represents sequences of characters and is used for text manipulation.
    - **list:** List data type represents ordered sequences of items and is mutable (can be modified).
    - **tuple:** Tuple data type represents ordered sequences of items and is immutable (cannot be modified).
3. **Set Types:**
    
    - **set:** Set data type represents an unordered collection of unique items.
    - **frozenset:** Frozenset data type represents an immutable version of a set.
4. **Mapping Type:**
    
    - **dict:** Dictionary data type represents key-value pairs, where each key is unique and maps to a corresponding value.
5. **Boolean Type:**
    
    - **bool:** Boolean data type represents Boolean values, `True` or `False`, used for logical operations.
6. **None Type:**
    
    - **NoneType:** The `None` type represents the absence of a value or a null value. It is often used to indicate that a variable or a function does not have a meaningful value.
