**Definition**
	Simple- Operators are special symbols or keywords that perform operations on variables and values.
	Own- Operators are symbols with certain properties to manipulate data in variables in different ways like numeric ,logical etc...

list of all the operators:
### Arithmetic Operators:

- `+` (Addition)
- `-` (Subtraction)
- `*` (Multiplication)
- `/` (Division)
- `%` (Modulus)
- `**` (Exponentiation)
- `//` (Floor Division)

### Comparison Operators:

- `==` (Equal to)
- `!=` (Not equal to)
- `<` (Less than)
- `>` (Greater than)
- `<=` (Less than or equal to)
- `>=` (Greater than or equal to)

### Logical Operators:

- `and` (Logical AND)
- `or` (Logical OR)
- `not` (Logical NOT)

### Assignment Operators:

- `=` (Assign)
- `+=` (Add and assign)
- `-=` (Subtract and assign)
- `*=` (Multiply and assign)
- `/=` (Divide and assign)
- `%=` (Modulus and assign)
- `**=` (Exponentiate and assign)
- `//=` (Floor divide and assign)

### Identity Operators:

- `is` (True if the operands are identical objects)
- `is not` (True if the operands are not identical objects)

### Membership Operators:

- `in` (True if a value is found in the sequence)
- `not in` (True if a value is not found in the sequence)

### Bitwise Operators:

- `&` (Bitwise AND)
- `|` (Bitwise OR)
- `^` (Bitwise XOR)
- `~` (Bitwise NOT)
- `<<` (Left shift)
- `>>` (Right shift)

### Special Operators:

- `:` (Colon, used in slices, loops, and defining functions and classes)
- `,` (Comma, used to separate items in a tuple or elements in a list)
- `.` (Dot, used for accessing attributes or methods of objects)
- `()` (Parentheses, used for function calls and defining tuples)
- `[]` (Square brackets, used for defining lists and indexing)
- `{}` (Curly braces, used for defining dictionaries, sets, and defining code blocks in loops and conditional statements)
