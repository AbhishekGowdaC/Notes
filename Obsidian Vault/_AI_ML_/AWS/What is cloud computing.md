```cloud computing```
Cloud Computing is the ***on*-*demand* *delivery*** of computer power, database storage, applications, and other **IT*** resources

`Characteristics`
**On-demand self service**,
**Broad network access**,
**Multi-tenancy and resource pooling**,
**Rapid elasticity and scalability**,
**Measured service**.

Guys as you can see in the Above Image there is a connection between the PC, tablet to the cloud which provides the **Storage*** on demand by the user.

```about```  
Through a cloud services platform with **pay**-**as**-**you**-**go** **pricing**.
We can ***provision exactly the  right type and size of computing*** resources we may needed, as many as we required, that to be almost instantly.

***Hybrid Cloud*** : Keep some servers on site and extend some capabilities to the cloud, **control over sensitive assets**, **Flexibility and cost effectiveness of the public cloud**. 

`advatage`
***CAPEX* for operational expense**,
**Benefit from massive economies of scale**,
**Stop guessing capacity**,
**Increase speed and agility**,
**Go global in minutes**.

`Problem solved`
**Flexibility**,
**Cost-Effectiveness**,
**Scalability**,
**Elasticity**,
**Agility**.
