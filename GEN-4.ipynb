It begins with an artist's hand drawn character. A character who looks like a human being is drawn into the city, but is also a small, cartoonishly grotesque creature with a penchant for being made of plastic and plastic-shaped objects. The character is created by artist Paul B. Brantley in the late 1990s, and ends up drawn in the style of a character from the film The Man Who Would Be King.\n",
